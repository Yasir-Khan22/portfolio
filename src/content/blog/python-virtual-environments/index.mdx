In this guide, we will look at different ways of creating virtual environments in Python. Virtual environments are used to manage dependencies and isolate projects from one another. This helps avoid conflicts between different versions of packages and ensures that each project has its own set of dependencies. 

Creating virtual environments in Python is essential for managing dependencies and ensuring that projects remain isolated from one another. Here are three common ways to create Python virtual environments:

### 1. Using `venv`

The `venv` module is included in the Python standard library and is the most straightforward way to create a virtual environment. It is lightweight and easy to use. To create a virtual environment using `venv`, run the following command:

1. <h3>Steps to Create and Activate a Virtual Environment using venv:</h3>

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, run:

```python
# python -m venv <Name-of-the-virtual-environment>
python -m venv .venv 
```

2. <h3>Activate the virtual environment:</h3>

```python
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

```python
# For Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to show the active environment (e.g., (.venv)), indicating that the virtual environment is active.


### 2. Using "virtualenv"

virtualenv is an older tool that is still widely used and can create virtual environments for both Python 2 and Python 3. Unlike venv, virtualenv offers additional flexibility and compatibility with older versions of Python.

Before using it, you need to install virtualenv. Use pip to install:

```python
pip install virtualenv
```

Steps to Create and Activate a Virtual Environment using virtualenv:
Create a virtual environment: You can create a virtual environment similarly to venv:

```python 
virtualenv .venv 
```
2. <h3>Activate the virtual environment:</h3>

```python
# For Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
```python
# For Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```
